        <p>
          My journey into <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> started the same way it does for a lot of people —
          curiosity, a few cards, and the realization that this game was something special.
        </p>

        <p>
          What hooked me wasn’t just playing games. It was <strong>building decks</strong>.
          The choices. The synergies. The moment when a pile of cards transforms into something
          cohesive, dangerous, and uniquely yours.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, deckbuilding became an obsession. I loved finding commanders that spoke to a theme,
          tuning mana bases so they actually worked, and making sure every deck had a clear plan to win.
          No filler. No bulk for the sake of hitting 100 cards. Just purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          Friends started asking for decks. Then friends of friends. Then people wanted
          <em>surprise decks</em> — something fun, playable, and ready to shuffle up immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s where <strong>ManaThrone</strong> was born.
        </p>

        <p>
          ManaThrone isn’t about gambling on random cards. It’s about delivering
          <strong>real Commander decks</strong> built by someone who genuinely cares about how they play.
          Every mystery box represents hours of thought, testing, and love for the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’ve ever opened a deck and thought, <em>“Yeah… this just works,”</em>
          then you already understand the goal.
        </p>

          <strong>Welcome to ManaThrone.<br>
          Take your seat.</strong>
